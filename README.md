This is a webpage for Scale Selector.

Scale Selector is a guitar fretboard visualizer that displays all the notes of the selected musical scale as finger placement indicators on the fretboard.

Visualization options include the following selectors.

1) The number of guitar strings, from 6 to 9.
2) The musical scale.
3) The root note on which the scale will start.
4) The number of frets to display, 12 or 24.
5) Chords view mode: scale tones, triads, or tetrads.
6) Chord degree selection (for triad/tetrad views).
7) Finger placement indicators, notes or intervals.
8) Finger placement indicators, color corresponding to interval or monochromatic.
9) Chord progressions with CAGED/position-based display for common progressions (I-IV-V, ii-V-I, etc.).
10) Root string selection (4th, 5th, or 6th) for CAGED position anchoring.
11) Voicing/inversion selection (Root, 1st, 2nd, 3rd) for triads and tetrads.
12) Drop tuning support for the lowest string.

Features:
- Bass notes are highlighted with thick white outlines
- Key root anchor on the selected root string gets a halo effect in position mode
- Voicing works for both single chords and progressions
- Mono mode maintains neutral grayscale regardless of chord/voicing selections
